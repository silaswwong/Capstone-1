# Motivation
<p>The obesity epidemic in the U.S. is clearly a significant problem that needs to be solved. Like so many pressing issues, there are many underlying factors that contribute to the obesity epidemic. Given the immense cost measured in dollars and quality of life that obesity has on the U.S., it is pertinent to identify the top indicators of obesity and direct resources to those indicators to combat the obesity epidemic as quickly and effectively as possible.</p>
